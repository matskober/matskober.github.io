Finally my Jekyll-on-Github blog is up and running. It's been a step learning curve, one could say if in need of a clich√©, but I'm not sure how much I've learned, to be honest. This post is an attempt to extract some knowledge out of this digital roller-coaster experience. And also get a bit more familiar with markdown.

## The starting point

In connection with some ongoing studies/projects of mine, I was looking into ways to make a simple app based on html/css files generated from xml/xslt. The term "static website generator" seemed to tick some boxes, and of course I went down that rabbit hole, research-vice. On a low/no-budget, that tends to happen. The green fields of opensoure and ~~free-range ~~ free-of-charge software, can easily become a maze of confusing opportunities and hard choices.

And then there is Windows.

## Caught in the middle

The biggest problem I ran into when trying to grasp how to use Jekyll, was of course my lack of digital competence, paired with my tendency not to make to much preparations - or any planning at all, actually. I just sort of jumped in, following some how-to-page I ~~googled~~ binged up - just to realize it was referring to a non-Windows computer.  But not to worry, if I just installed ... 

Retrospectively, I would assume a plan ~~would~~ could be to: 

1. Go *Microsoft Store* and install the *Ubuntu* (or *Debian*) app. This will make your Windows computer "Linux-compatible". 
2. Download and install *Ruby*, *RubyGem*, *Bundle* and *Jekyll*.
3. Log in  to [GitHub](https://github.com) find a blog-template (I used [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)), fork this, give it at new name (your_user_name.github.io)
4. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
5. Clone "your_user_name.github.io" to  a folder of your choosing on your computer using *GitHub Desktop*

At this point it should be possible, whit a few edits in the *config.yml* file (e.g. the "url", pointing it to "https.//your_user_name.github.io") to push this back and let GitHub do the building and deploying.
