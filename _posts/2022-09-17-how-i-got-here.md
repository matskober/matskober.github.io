Finely my Jekyll-on-Github blog is up and running. It's been a step learning curve, one could say if in need of a clich√©, but I'm not sure how much I've learned, to be honest. This post is an attempt to extract some knowledge out of this digital roller-coaster experience. And also get a bit more familiar with markdown.

## The starting point

In connection with some ongoing studies/projects of mine, I was looking into ways to make a simple app based on html/css files generated from xml/xslt. The term "static website generator" seemed to tick some boxes, and then I went down that rabbit hole, research-vice. On a low/no-budget, that tends to happen. The green fields of opensoure and free-of-charge software, can easily become a maze of opportunities and choices.
