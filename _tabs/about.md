## From a Study Room

This blog is a project in itself - me learning to use Jekyll and GitHub - and also a tool for me to use in other ongoing, and future, projects. That's the ambition, anyhow.

It is also intended to be a _personal_ research blog, therefor with topics covering my interests,  investigations and learning process - and hopefully some findings, reflections, thoughts, opinions and whatnot.

### Me

I'm not a talented programmer nor a brilliant academic, so _no reason to get excited_, to cite the kindly speaking thief. Still, I have more than two decades of experience working with text and literature in different ways, throughout the production cycles, and on a variety of platforms and formats.
